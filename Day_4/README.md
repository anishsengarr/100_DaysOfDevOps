# Networking Concepts and Protocols

## Types of Networks

**Types of Networks**:

1. **LAN (Local Area Network)**:
   - **Description:** Connects devices within a limited area such as a home, school, or office building.
   - **Use Case:** Networking within small to medium-sized areas.

2. **WAN (Wide Area Network)**:
   - **Description:** Connects devices over a large geographical area, often spanning cities, countries, or even continents.
   - **Use Case:** Networking for large organizations and the internet.

3. **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**:
   - **Description:** Covers a larger geographical area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, typically a city or campus.
   - **Use Case:** City-wide networking, connecting various LANs.

4. **PAN (Personal Area Network)**:
   - **Description:** Connects devices in the immediate vicinity of an individual, typically within a range of a few meters.
   - **Use Case:** Personal devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops.

5. **SAN (Storage Area Network)**:
   - **Description:** Dedicated network that provides access to consolidated, block-level data storage.
   - **Use Case:** Data storage and retrieval for servers and data centers.

6. **CAN (Campus Area Network)**:
   - **Description:** Covers a campus or group of buildings, such as a university or business campus.
   - **Use Case:** Networking for educational institutions or business campuses.

## Difference Between OSI and TCP/IP

| Aspect                   | OSI Model                            | TCP/IP Model                     |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Full Name**            | Open Systems Interconnection         | Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol |
| **Layers**               | 7 layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application | 4 layers: Network Interface, Internet, Transport, Application |
| **Development**          | Developed by ISO                     | Developed by DARPA               |
| **Standardization**      | Standard protocol model              | Protocol suite for the internet  |
| **Layer Interaction**    | Strictly defined layers with clear interactions | Layers are more flexible and not as strictly defined |
| **Use Cases**            | Conceptual framework for network design and troubleshooting | Practical implementation for the internet |

## TCP and UDP Protocols

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

**TCP**:
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transfer between devices. It establishes a connection before transmitting data and guarantees delivery of data packets in the correct order.

**Key Features**:
- Connection-oriented
- Reliable and ensures data delivery
- Error checking and flow control
- Data sequencing

**Use Cases**:
- Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Email (SMTP)
- File transfer (FTP)

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

**UDP**:
UDP is a connectionless protocol that does not guarantee delivery, order, or error checking of data packets. It is faster than TCP and is used for applications where speed is more critical than reliability.

**Key Features**:
- Connectionless
- Unreliable, no guarantee of data delivery
- No error checking or flow control
- Faster than TCP

**Use Cases**:
- Live streaming
- Online gaming
- VoIP (Voice over IP)

## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

**DHCP**:
DHCP is a network management protocol used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks. It assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and other network parameters to devices automatically.

**Key Features**:
- Automates IP address assignment
- Reduces manual configuration errors
- Provides IP address leasing

**Use Cases**:
- Managing IP addresses in a network
- Simplifying network administration

## Firewall

**Firewall**:
A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks.

**Key Features**:
- Monitors network traffic
- Enforces security policies
- Blocks unauthorized access
- Can be hardware-based or software-based

**Use Cases**:
- Protecting internal networks from external threats
- Controlling access to network resources
- Filtering out malicious traffic
